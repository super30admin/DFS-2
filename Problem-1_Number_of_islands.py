# APPROACH 1: BFS 
# Time Complexity : O(2*m*n) => O(m*n), m: number of rows of grid, n: number of columns of grid, each cell is visited only a max of 2 times (onefor BFS and other for checking if 1)
# Space Complexity : O(min(n, m))
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : None
#
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. Go through each element of grid. 
# 2. If cell value is 1, inc count and run BFS on it. Only traverse those cells that are 1 and change them to 0 so that we dont visit them again
# 3. For each cell check all it's 4 neighbors.
