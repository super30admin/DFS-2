"""
Using Recursive approach in which Stack is maintained and numbers are stored in 
stack and characters too  . While checking for all the characters in string
If '[' is encountered than a number is pushed in stack and And if ']' is 
encountered than we pop elements out of stack. and the current String is appended.
